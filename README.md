 As a mini-project with Digital Egypt Pioneers Initiative - DEPI , I explored a fascinating movie dataset to uncover insights about what drives a movie's success.

Highlights:

Top Performers: Identified the top 10 production companies by total net profit.

Audience and Profitability: Explored how audience votes and popularity relate to profitability.

Genres: Analyzed the most produced and highest-grossing genres.

Actor Impact: Investigated which actors contribute most to profitable movies.


Tools Used:

ðŸ”¹ SQL for querying and creating views
ðŸ”¹ Python with Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn for data analysis and visualization

What I Learned:

This was my first-ever project of this kind, and it was a rewarding experience! I learned how to handle interconnected datasets, create insightful visualizations, and derive meaningful conclusions.
